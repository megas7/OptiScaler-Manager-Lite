|**Version**
|0.7.7-pre7

|**Filename**
|`winmm.dll` (probably best for UWP/GP), `dxgi.dll` should also work

|**OS**
|Win 11

|**GPU**
|9070XT

|**Inputs**
|FSR, DLSS, XeSS

|**Settings**
|-

|**FG-Settings**
|-

|**Known Issues**
a|
* With spoofing active, FSR FG seems to be disabled? - Can use DLSS FG with Nukem in that case (or set `Dxgi=false` in `Optiscaler.ini` if you want native FSR FG with replaced FSR upscaler)
* UWP GamePass version seems to crash on FSR inputs, so try DLSS or XeSS (also for FSR4 upgrade) - if the game is crashing on boot, try removing the mod and disable upscalers in-game first

|**Notes**
|Requires `Fakenvapi` for DLSS inputs
