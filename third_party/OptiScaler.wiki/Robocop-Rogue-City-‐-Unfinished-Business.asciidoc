|**Notes**
a|
* Although I haven't tested FSR or XeSS inputs, the game recognizes the spoofed Nvidia GPU with no issues. (You'll need `fakenvapi` for this to work.)
* Using Nukem's DLSS-to-FSRFG works as intended, although, I noticed a slight uptick in both GPU utilization and power consumption with this method. (Your mileage may vary.)
* Using OptiFG also works as intended, in addition to having lower GPU utilization and power consumption. (Again, your mileage may vary.)
