|**Version**
|0.9.0-pre4

|**Filename**
|`dxgi.dll`

|**OS**
|Windows 11 24H2

|**GPU**
|AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT

|**Inputs**
|FSR3.1, DLSS

|**Settings**
|`Dxgi=false` recommended on AMD/Intel (FSR3.1 input only)

|**FG-Settings**
a|* FSR3.1 FG / DLSSG via Streamline source -> XeFG output

|**Known Issues**
a|* Using FSR4 at 77%-99% res, force "Model 1" to avoid foliage flickering.
* Resolution slider messes with FSR4 model selection, be sure to "reset" model (select a random one then default again) in case of flickering.
* When using DLSS input & FSR4 output, upon restarting, the resolution slider doesn't set the resolution % correctly, and resets to the nearest preset instead. Not an issue with FSR3.1 input.
* Spoofing for DLSS(G) inputs (`Dxgi=auto`) causes a ~9% performance penalty. Use different inputs instead with `Dxgi=false` or see the notes section for a workaround.

|**Notes**
a|* Older game versions didn't allow 100% resolution scale, as of patch 1.5.1 it seems to be working.
* DLSS(G) inputs without the performance penalty require https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiPatcher[OptiPatcher].
