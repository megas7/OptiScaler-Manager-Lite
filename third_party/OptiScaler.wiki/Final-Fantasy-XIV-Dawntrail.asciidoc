|**Known Issues**
a|
* OptiScaler needs to be injected as `winmm.dll` or `winhttp.dll`, it crashes as anything else
* Changes to the resolution scale require a game restart to apply.
* AMD/Intel users need `Fakenvapi` to expose DLSS in-game
* For Linux issues - check https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler/issues/629#issuecomment-3144270156[here]

|**Notes**
|Game forces 1.0 scaling with DLSS, use **Ratio Override** and enable **both DRS overrides** (Dynamic Res Scaling) as on the https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d4370d3-0481-4938-94e6-26b17e4380f5[screenshot] for custom scaling (requires re-enabling DLSS or restarting the game to apply)
