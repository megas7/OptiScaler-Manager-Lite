|OptiFG is very hit and miss in this game, it either works or it flat out doesn't (from older versions, 0.7-pre66 used to work)

|**Known Issues**
a|
* OptiFG HUDfix might not be working properly, depending on the version
* Spoofing causes weird rendering artifacts/crashes in certain places (like Valentine discoball artifact, or broken lights in cities) - **fixed when using https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiPatcher[OptiPatcher]** - check https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler/issues/388#issuecomment-3121911286[comment]

|**Notes**
a|
* **DirectX 12 is recommended to be used**, Vulkan is problematic
* Use Optiscaler as `winmm.dll` to successfully load, **AMD/Intel** users also need `Fakenvapi` if DLSS isn't exposed
* Renaming Optiscaler.dll to `OptiScaler.asi` and using https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases[Ultimate ASI Loader x64] as `winmm.dll`/`version.dll` also works - **most compatible way, needed for OptiPatcher way due to RGL**
* FSR2 inputs are questionable, Steam version crashes, so disable FSR2 in game settings before adding Optiscaler (or set `Fsr2=false` in Optiscaler.ini, automatically done in 0.7.7-pre12 and above) - recommended to use DLSS inputs
* If Optiscaler isn't working (generally Vulkan), another possible way should be renaming Optiscaler.dll to `nvngx.dll` and using https://github.com/0x-FADED/RDR2-NVNGX-Loader[RDR2-NVNGX-Loader] with Optiscaler (overlay may not work). - **_FSR4 Upgrade not supported this way, also outdated thanks to OptiPatcher_**
* Compatible with Lenny's Mod Loader
* Turning on NV Reflex with Fakenvapi can cause stutters.
