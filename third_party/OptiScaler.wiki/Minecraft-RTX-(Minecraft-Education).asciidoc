|**Known Issues**
|Frame Generation works, though `HUDFix` cannot detect the UI properly and `FG Allow Async` makes the game unplayable.    
Upscaling Quality Overrides, Anisotropic Filtering and DirectX Mipmap Bias cannot be changed whilst in the game and can only be modified through `nvngx.ini`.    
DLSS Render Presets do not work whatsoever. DLSSTweaks is recommended as an alternative.    
Certain render resolutions on presets may cause "black bars".    

|**Notes**
|When using Frame Generation, be sure to assign window resolution before the game launches as any post-launch changes to window aspects causes warping.    
`imgui` causes crashing in non-Preview builds of Minecraft Education. This is possibly caused by Themida. Preview builds are recommended if you want to access OptiScaler's Overlay.
