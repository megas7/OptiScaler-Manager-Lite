|**OS**
|Windows 11 24H2

|**GPU**

|**Inputs**
|DLSS, FSR2 (not supported)

|**Settings**
|-

|**FG-Settings**
|`nukems`; 0.9.0 onwards: DLSSG via Streamline input, FSRFG or XeFG output

|**Known Issues**
a|
* FSR2 inputs not supported.
* Overlay doesn't work consistently in fullscreen mode - use fullscreen windowed for best compatibility.
* Mouse could be bounded to the game, either go to the game menu or use keyboard to navigate through Optiscaler overlay.
* Subtitles and other text in cutscenes may appear blurry when using Nukem mod.  
* Linux requires `dxvk.conf` spoofing for whatever reason - https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler/blob/master/Spoofing.md#linux[link]

|**Notes**
a|
* Use DLSS inputs as that unlocks DLSS FG with Nukem mod too (requires `Fakenvapi` if not exposed, also gives AL2)
