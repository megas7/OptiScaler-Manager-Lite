|**Known Issues**
a|
* DLSS FG HUDless broken (no point in using Nukem's mod or DLSSG SL inputs) - _simply impressive to say this for 2 games in a row, bravo Techland_   
* Mouse click input not hooked properly - use keyboard to navigate and apply settings (arrow keys, Tab and Space)   
* Reflex markers are working questionably, but needs verification


|**Notes**
a|
* Officially the first game to implement FFX 2.0 SDK and FSR4 natively
* Game has XeFG, but ships with XeSS 2.0 files. Updating to XeSS 2.1 unlocks XeFG for everyone and seems to work well.
* SL Spoof seems to unlock everything on 9070XT, so `Dxgi=false` is recommended
