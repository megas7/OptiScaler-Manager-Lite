|**Known Issues**
a|
* Upscalers work, but Optiscaler Overlay does not and can't be invoked due to not being able to capture keyboard inputs (**check Notes**) - change settings in `Optiscaler.ini`/`nvngx.ini` only.
* OptiFG is HUDfix incompatible, can't capture the HUD/UI fully

|**Notes**
a|
* Enhanced edition is the only version with DLSS 2, Standard edition is not supported due to DLSS1  

* **Workaround for invisible Overlay** - in combination with **SpecialK**, Opti Overlay becomes visible and useable (albeit mouse input still doesn't work, so KBM is required - arrow keys, Tab and Space)
* Install SpecialK using Opti's **"plugins"** folder method https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler/wiki/Compatibility-with-other-mods-(Reshade,-SpecialK)[(link)] - get `SpecialK64.dll`, rename it to whatever you renamed Opti (usually `dxgi.dll`) and put it in a "plugins" folder where Metro game exe is located - https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd7cfde7-a0ae-44fe-bfec-e8cd4b839de7[Tutorial]

* When using FSR4 on-screen corruption with all presets but best with Balanced/Ultra Performance, recommended to use FSR 4.0.0, as 4.0.1 is worse in that regard.
