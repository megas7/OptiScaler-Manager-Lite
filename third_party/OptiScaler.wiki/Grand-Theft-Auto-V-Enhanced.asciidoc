|**Filename**
|`dxgi.dll`, `winmm.dll`

|**OS**
|Win 11 24H2

|**GPU**
|RX 6950XT

|**Inputs**
|DLSS, FSR3.1

|**Settings**
|`Dxgi=false` to stop crashing for just FSR inputs; for DLSS inputs - requires `Fakenvapi` for **AMD/Intel**

|**FG-Settings**
|Nukems should be working fine now since DLSS-FG was added

|**Known Issues**
a|
* For OptiScaler to work, requires **disabling Battleye** anticheat - check the screenshot below
* Upscaler presets are hardcoded - overriding won't work

|**Notes**
|Both DLSS and FSR3.1 inputs seem to work fine, AL2 injection with Fakenvapi also seems to work well
