|**Filename**
|`dxgi.dll`

|**OS**
|Win 11 24H2

|**GPU**
|RX 6950XT

|**Inputs**
|DLSS, FSR2 (not supported)

|**Settings**
|-

|**FG-Settings**
|OptiFG not supported as HUDfix is incompatible

|**Known Issues**
a|
* FSR2 inputs not supported  (set `Fsr2=false` in `OptiScaler.ini` to make DLSS available in game settings)
* Requires using DLSS inputs, Frame Generation unlocked with Nukem `dlssg-to-fsr3` mod (and `Fakenvapi` for AL2/LFX injection)
* Nukem's FG will make the game crash during intro logos if Epic overlay is not disabled. See issue https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler/issues/101[#101] for more details.

|**Notes**
|To stop ghosting with FG, requires _**disabling Lens Distortion** and maybe **Vignette**_ in game settings - older game versions don't have settings exposed, requires disabling in game config `renderer.ini` (`"m_bLensDistortion": false` - check **PCGW** for more info)
