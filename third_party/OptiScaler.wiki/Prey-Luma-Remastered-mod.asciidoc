* Requires https://www.nexusmods.com/prey2017/mods/149[**Prey Remastered - Luma mod**], which requires **ReShade with Add-on support** (read the mod's Readme for installation steps)  
* Recommended to use Opti as `OptiScaler.asi` + ReShade as `ReShade.asi` (rename Reshade's `dxgi.dll` to `ReShade.asi`) + https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases[Ultimate ASI Loader x64] (works as default `dinput8.dll`)
