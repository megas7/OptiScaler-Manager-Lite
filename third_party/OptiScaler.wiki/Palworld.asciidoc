|**Filename**
|`dxgi.dll`

|**OS**
|Windows 11 24H2

|**GPU**
|Radeon RX 7900 XTX

|**Inputs**
|DLSS 3.1

|**Settings**
|`Auto Exposure ON` for XeSS

|**Known Issues**
|XeSS needs **Auto Exposure ON** in overlay - otherwise flickery (or `Autoexposure=true` in nvngx.ini) 

|**Notes**
a|
* OptiFG works, but there's ghosting around the HUD while panning the camera. If you toggle on `FG HUD Fix` and leave it in the default +1 value, then it will mitigate this issue
* Multiple people also mentioned that you might have to toggle off and on DLSS in-game to get Opti to properly hook it. Game is weird. _Also disable DLSS, change anti-aliasing to TSR and enable DLSS again. For some reason it is required._
