|**Known Issues**
a|
* At the time of reporting this, with the latest Adrenalin 25.6.3 driver, using Nukem's DLSS-to-FSRFG causes erratic frametime spikes. (Your mileage may vary; please see the Notes section for a solution.) 

|**Notes**
a|
* Since the game only features DLSS, you'll have to use the DLSS inputs if you want to use XeSS or FSR 2.X.X/3.X. (You'll need `fakenvapi` for this to work.)
* Using OptiFG works as intended, along with having smoother frametimes and higher 1% Lows compared to the DLSSG method.
