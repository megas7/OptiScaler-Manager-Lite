|**OS**
|Win 11 24H2

|**GPU**
|RX 6950XT

|**Inputs**
|DLSS, FSR2 (not supported)

|**Known Issues**
a|
* Recommended to use Optiscaler as `dbghelp.dll` for early hooking
* For AMD/Intel, requires **Fakenvapi** along with setting `Vulkan=true` and `VulkanExtensionSpoofing=true` in **Optiscaler.ini**
* Overlays not working properly is a side-effect of an anti-crash measure when using Nukems FG mod 

|**Notes**
a|
* Since the game was updated with XeSS, XeSS inputs can be used without spoofing
* Pre12 and Pre13 Nightlies + Fakenvapi 1.3.4 + Nukems 0.130 seem to work fine for AMD/Intel, broken rendering and such issues when using DLSS inputs have been fixed

|v0.7.7-pre9

|**Filename**
|dxgi.dll

|**OS**
|Windows 11 24H2

|**GPU**
|AMD RX 9070 XT (driver: 25.6.1)

|**Inputs**
|FSR 3.1 (overriding native XeSS)

|**Settings**
|Default settings from automatic `.bat` install. Ensure the in-game upscaler is set to XeSS, as OptiScaler will override this to FSR 3.1.

|**FG-Settings**
|None

|**Known Issues**
|None encountered.

|**Notes**
|Achieved significant performance gains by overriding the game's native XeSS implementation with FSR 3.1.
Playing on a 4K 240Hz monitor, FPS increased from approximately 100-120 FPS (using native FSR 2.x) to 140-160 FPS (using OptiScaler with FSR 3.1) in demanding areas like the space anomaly. This represents a performance gain of roughly 33-40%.

|**Filename**
|winmm.dll

|**OS**
|-

|**GPU**
|RTX 2070 Super

|**Inputs**
|DLSS

|**Settings**
|Either use the default settings for spoofing OR set both ``Dxgi`` and ``Vulkan`` to true.

|**FG-Settings**
|Nukem's dlssg-to-fsr3

|**Known Issues**
|FG constantly disabling itself. DLSS Upscaling by itself might cause low fps after alt-tabbing. Trying to open the Opti's overlay when DLSSG is active will freeze the game.

|**Notes**
|Wrong spoofing option will make DLSSG not show up in the options and you will see vulkan errors in the log.
