|**Known Issues**
a|
* AMD users may need to set `VulkanExtensionSpoofing=true` in `Optiscaler.ini` to not crash on boot.
* DLSS inputs are not unlockable on AMD/Intel, spoofing doesn't work due to extra checks
* RTSS overlay might conflict with Optiscaler - when RTSS active, Opti overlay is invisible, when you hide RTSS, Opti overlay works fine
* While FSR FG is turned ON, RTSS overlay causes crashes - https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-and-overlay-compatibility.456384/[workaround]
* While FSR FG is turned ON, invoking Opti Overlay causes crashes - workaround is to disable FG first

|**Notes**
a|
* Using Optiscaler as `winmm.dll` works
* Overlay menu sometimes may not invoke properly, but Optiscaler itself works - can edit settings in `Optiscaler.ini` in that case
* FSR 3.1 FG sadly isn't decoupled, but you can replace FSR with XeSS and still use FSR FG (should work with DLSS also)

|**Known Issues**
|Menu will be invisible when opened. DLSS disabled in menu when using OptiScaler, but still works when selecting FSR/XeSS in-game (confirmed with overlay). DLSSG to FSR3 works separately when not using OptiScaler.

|**Notes**
|Using ASI method because of https://www.nexusmods.com/indianajonesandthegreatcircle/mods/56[GreatCircleFix], which uses ASI loader. UWP version used.
