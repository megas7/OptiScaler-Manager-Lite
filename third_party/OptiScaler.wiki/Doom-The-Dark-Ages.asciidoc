|**Version**
|0.7.7-pre9, 0.7.7-pre11

|**Filename**
|`winmm.dll`

|**OS**
|Win 11 24H2

|**GPU**
|RX 6950XT

|**Inputs**
|FSR3.1, XeSS, DLSS (not working for AMD/Intel)

|**Settings**
|-

|**FG-Settings**
|-

|**Known Issues**
a|
* DLSS inputs are not unlockable on AMD/Intel, spoofing doesn't work due to extra checks, Nukem also won't work on AMD consequently
* RTSS overlay conflicts with Optiscaler - when RTSS active, Opti overlay is invisible, when you hide RTSS, Opti overlay works fine
* While FSR FG is turned ON, RTSS overlay causes crashes - https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-and-overlay-compatibility.456384/[workaround]
* While FSR FG is turned ON, invoking Opti Overlay causes crashes - workaround is to disable FG first


|**Notes**
a|
* Using Optiscaler as `winmm.dll` works
* FSR 3.1 FG sadly isn't decoupled, but you can replace FSR with XeSS and still use FSR FG (should work with DLSS also)
* To update the FSR DLL, replace the one in `amd-ffx` folder
