|Radeon RX 7900 XTX

|**Inputs**
|DLSS 3.5, FSR 3.0

|**Settings**

|**FG-Settings**
|Nukem's DLSSG

|**Known Issues**
a|
* If using DLSS inputs keeps crashing, try enabling `RestoreComputeSignature=true` or `RestoreGraphicSignature=true` in **Optiscaler.ini** (or `Restore Compute/Graphic Root Signature` under Root Signatures menu in Opti Overlay)  
* For MH Rise, `RestoreComputeSignature=true` was enough to fix DLSS crashes  
* To fix GUI with DLSS inputs (with/without FG), user reported `RestoreComputeSignature=true` was enough (or `Restore Compute Root Signature` under Root Signatures menu in Opti Overlay)
* For this game, OptiFG works but it has a lot of ghosting/garbling around the HUD and characters. (Regardless of using FG HUD Fix; please see the Notes section for a solution.)

|**Notes**
a|
* Requires REFramework to work
* If you want to use Nukem's DLSS-to-FSRG, you'll need both `fakenvapi` and `dlss_to_fsr3_amd_is_better.dll` files within the root folder
* When you're enabling Nvidia Frame Generation in settings, you cannot toggle Nvidia Low Latency mode when it's active. Instead, you can use LatencyFlex option to reduce the system latency
