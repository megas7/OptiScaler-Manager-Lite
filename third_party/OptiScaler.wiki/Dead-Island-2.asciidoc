|**Known Issues**
a|
* **Nvidia users need to add DLSS dll** since no nvngx_dlss.dll in the game -> simply download the file ( for example with DLSS Swapper / or copy it from the folder of any game that has DLSS ) and paste it next to Optiscaler
* Autoswitching to DLSS on Nvidia causes a crash since no DLSS dll

|**Notes**
a|
* AMD/Intel users, select **No** when asked about DLSS inputs
* During installation, selecting DLSS instead of FSR as inputs will break Screen Space Reflections from the middle of the screen. No issues playing online on Epic Games Store.
