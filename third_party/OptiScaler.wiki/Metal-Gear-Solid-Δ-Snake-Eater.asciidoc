|**Version**
|v0.9.0-pee1

|**Filename**
|`dxgi.dll`

|**OS**
|Windows 11 24H2

|**GPU**
|Radeon RX 7900 XTX

|**Inputs**
|DLSS 3.1, FSR 3

|**Settings**
|`HUD Fix 2+ & Force Reflex (Force Enabled)` for OptiFG

|**FG-Settings**
|`Optiscaler (Upscaler) -> FSR FG` or `Nukem's DLSSG -> FSR-FG via Nukem`

|**Known Issues**
a|
* After some brief testing, it appears that selecting `Optiscaler (Upscaler) -> XeFG` doesn't work. (See Notes section for a solution.)
* After extensively playing, it appears that using `Nukem's DLSSG -> FSR-FG via Nukem` is causing Improper Frame Pacing for every other third frame. Reverting to OptiFG alleviated this problem for my rig. (Your mileage may vary, considering that some people aren't experiencing this issue.)

|**Notes**
a|
* The game has slight ghosting/garbling around the HUD, when using OptiFG; enabling HUD Fix 2+ will completely eliminate this.
* As of Ver. 1.1.2, the game still doesn't feature DLSS Frame Generation, FSR 3 Frame Generation and Nvidia Reflex. However, the game contains those necessary plugins; it's just not visible in the Graphics Settings to the end user. To enable them, go to C:\Users\[User Name]\App Data\Local\MGSDelta\Saved\Config\Windows and click on `Engine.ini`. Scroll all the way to the bottom and add the following lines below (the ones starting with `[SystemSettings]`).
* After adding those lines, add Nukem's `dlss-to-fsr3-amd-is-better.dll` and FakeMichau's `fakenvapi` into the root game folder and you'll see both DLSSG and Anti-Lag 2/XeLL running.
