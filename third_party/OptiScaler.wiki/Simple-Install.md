* **Scene:** Opti lands in a giant toy box, which is the game's folder. He opens the **OptiScaler** box, and out pop a bunch of colorful, friendly-looking files. They look like little robot helpers, each with a different shape and color. They all jump out and neatly line up inside the toy box.
* **Cartoon Opti says:** "Time to let out my little helpers! They know just what to do!"

* **Scene:** Opti finds a special magic wand in the toy box labeled "**OptiScaler Setup**." He waves the wand, and it shoots out colorful sparks that zap each of the little file-bots. When a file-bot gets zapped, it changes its name with a funny "poof!" sound. The file-bots all cheer and do a silly dance with their new names.
* **Cartoon Opti says:** "Abracadabra! With a wave of my magic wand, everyone is ready to go!"

* **Cartoon Opti says:** "Some computers need a special friend. I'll say 'Yes' to my new helper, Dee! Together, we're an awesome team!"

* **Scene:** Oh no! The magic wand sputters and the sparks fizzle out. Opti looks a little sad. But then, a friendly little light appears and unrolls a treasure map. The map shows a secret path to a hidden, sparkling treasure chest. Opti follows the map and finds the treasure chest with a special key inside, labeled "**nvngx_dlss.dll**".
* **Cartoon Opti says:** "Even when things don't go as planned, there's always another way! This treasure map will lead me to the secret key to finish the mission!"
