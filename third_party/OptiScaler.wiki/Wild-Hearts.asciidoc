|**Filename**
|`dxgi.dll`

|**OS**
|Windows 11 24H2

|**GPU**
|Radeon RX 7900 XTX

|**Inputs**
|DLSS 2

|**Settings**
|-

|**FG-Settings**
|`FGType=optifg`

|**Known Issues**
a|
* Using XeSS causes flickering in ambient occlusion and shadows, regardless of having `Auto Exposure ON`
* Using XeSS or FSR via DLSS inputs will cause rainbow pixels to appear around smoke, dust, and other certain effects. (There's a way to resolve this below, in the Notes section.)
* Using Opti FG causes ghosting/garbling around the HUD elements. Although using `FG HUD Fix` at +2 value (and beyond) addresses the issue, it also causes the game to feel sluggish in comparison to the default +1 setting 

|**Notes**
a|
* Since the game uses FSR 1, you'll have to use the DLSS inputs if you want to use XeSS or FSR 2.X.X/3.X
* To get rid of the rainbow pixels found in certain effects, you must play the game with Opti FG turned on
