|**Notes**
a|
* Since the game uses FSR 1, you'll have to use the DLSS inputs if you want to use XeSS or FSR 2.X.X/3.X
* Since the game uses DX11, and you want to use XeSS or FSR 3.X, you'll need to update the `Dx11Upscaler` line from "auto" to "xess_12" or "fsr31_12"
* Since the game uses DX11, you will not be able to use OptiFG since it's only supported in DX12
