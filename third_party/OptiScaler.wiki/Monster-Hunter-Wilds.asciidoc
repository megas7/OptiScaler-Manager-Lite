|**Known Issues**
a|
* With OptiFG setting, game used to hang after closing  
* If crashing before or during shader compilation, use `Dxgi=false` on **AMD/Intel** as the game does not seem to like spoofing (no DLSS inputs this way) - use FSR 3.1 or XeSS inputs
* **Disable Motion Blur** as it messes with FG options - causes graphical artifacts for DLSSG SL inputs

|**Notes**
|Requires **REFramework** to work
