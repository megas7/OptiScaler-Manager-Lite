|**Known Issues**
| Anti-cheat/anti-tamper normally blocks launch when unexpected .dll files are injected, like Optiscaler - see notes. +
  Have not tested whether OptiScaler can function as an ASI loader.

|**Notes**
| Navigate to ``Marvel\'s Midnight Suns\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\DbgHelp\`` and rename or delete the existing dbghelp.dll. +
  OptiScaler should be installed in ``Marvel\'s Midnight Suns\MidnightSuns\Binaries\Win64\`` using `dbghelp.dll` as the selected dll filename.
