|**Version**
|v0.7.7-pre9_Daria

|**Filename**
|`dxgi.dll`

|**OS**
|Windows 11 24H2

|**GPU**
|Radeon RX 7900 XTX

|**Inputs**
|DLSS 4, FSR 3.1

|**Settings**
|-

|**FG-Settings**
|`FGType=nukems`

|**Known Issues**
a|
* OptiFG works, but there's ghosting around the HUD while panning the camera. If you toggle on `FG HUD Fix`, then it will cause the FG to feel jittery while playing.

|**Notes**
a|
* Although the game doesn't support natively XeSS, XeSS 2.0.1 works fine (without any additional toggles needed) via DLSS or FSR inputs.
* If you want to use Frame Generation and Anti-Lag 2/LatencyFlex injection, then use `dlssg_to_fsr3_amd_is_better.dll`, `fakenvapi`, and `nvapi64.dll`, along with setting `FGType=nukems` in OptiScaler.ini.
* If done correctly, the game will recognize the spoofed Nvidia GPU and will grant you access to toggling DLSS, Automatic/2x Frame Gen, while Reflex is automatically forced on (when using Frame Gen).
