|**Filename**
|`dxgi.dll`, `version.dll`

|**OS**
|Win 11 24H2

|**GPU**
|RX 6950XT

|**Inputs**
|DLSS

|**Settings**
a|
* If using BAT file and on **AMD/Intel**, select **Yes** to DLSS Inputs, but set `Dxgi=false` in Optiscaler.ini
* `Dxgi=false` also needed for Manual steps on **AMD/Intel**

|**FG-Settings**
|-

|**Known Issues**
|Spoofing causes massive performance overhead, by far the biggest seen so far, hence the needed `Dxgi=false` setting for AMD/Intel - https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/852a2a8f-a85e-4788-99a0-36df58ca0167[Pre-spoof], https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5b97092-0d6c-48db-9855-991116d42a33[Post-spoof]

|**Notes**
a|
* Game seems to expose DLSS inputs just by having a nvngx.dll file
* DXCompiler no longer needed to be updated for XeSS 2.0, seems to work fine
