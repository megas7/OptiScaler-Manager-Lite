|**Version**
|Optiscaler v0.7.7-pre7

|**Filename**
|`version.dll`, `winmm.dll` (UWP/GP), `dxgi.dll` (avoid for UWP/GP)

|**OS**
|Windows 10, Win 11 24H2

|**GPU**
|RTX 2080S, RX 6950XT

|**Inputs**
|DLSS + DLSS FG, FSR3 (check Known Issues)

|**Settings**
|Set `ColorResourceBarrier=0` in `Optiscaler.ini` to prevent crashing past title screen

|**FG-Settings**
|Set `FGType=Nukems` with Nukem's `dlssg-to-fsr3` v0.120+

|**Known Issues**
a|
* Slight ghosting on weapons seems to be a lingering effect, not related to Nukems mod; 
* To fix FSR3 inputs from crashing, add `r.FidelityFX.FSR3.UseNativeDX12=1` to game's `Engine.ini` config file (check screenshot below, _%LOCALAPPDATA%\Alabama\Saved\Config\Windows_ or _WinGDK_) (might crash on switch to 3rd person perspective)
* GamePass users might have to delete the Config folder to reset settings if not working after everything
* For fixing UW issues where upscaler context breaks in cutscenes/dialogues, check https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler/issues/332#issuecomment-2940618823[link]

|**Notes**
|Haven't seen any issues after hours of playing. Framegen works well.
