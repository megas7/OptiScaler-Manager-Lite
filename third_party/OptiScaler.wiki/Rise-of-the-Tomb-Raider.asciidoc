|**Version**
|0.7.7-pre11, 0.7.7-pre12

|**Filename**
|`dxgi.dll`

|**OS**
|Win 11 24H2

|**GPU**
|6950XT, Radeon 780M (pre11)

|**Inputs**
|DLSS only game

|**Settings**
|If you want to use OptiFG, boot the game in DirectX 12 mode.

|**FG-Settings**
|HUDfix incompatible, but the game doesn't have much UI, so just FG Active might be worth it, but personal preference

|**Known Issues**
|Would recommend disabling DoF, Vignette Blur, Motion Blur, Lens Flare, Screen Effects and Film Grain

|**Notes**
|Should expose DLSS with dxgi method and spoofing. If it still doesn't expose DLSS, try using Michau's https://github.com/FakeMichau/fakenvapi[FakeNVapi]. If you get weird Xmas artifacts, try disabling in-game Screen Effects (other possible fixes - `AutoExposure=true` or in imGUI overlay, or `ColorResourceBarrier=4` in `Optiscaler.ini`) +
