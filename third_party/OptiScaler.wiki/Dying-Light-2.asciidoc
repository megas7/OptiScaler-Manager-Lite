|**GPU**
|RX 6950XT

|**Inputs**
|DLSS, XeSS, FSR2 (not working)

|**Known Issues**
a|
* DLSS FG HUDless broken (no point in using Nukem's mod)   
* HUDfix broken (no point in using OptiFG -> FSR FG) - XeFG might be its saving grace   
* Changing in-game Sharpness may result in crash - recommend using Sharpness Override in Optiscaler overlay   
* Mouse click input not hooked properly - use keyboard to navigate and apply settings (arrow keys, Tab and Space)   
* FSR2 inputs not working   
* Fakenvapi AL2 injection can cause microstutters? - try using LFX (and restart the game if live switching)  

|**Notes**
a|
* Run the game in **DX12**.  
* For AMD(Intel) users, requires using Michau's `Fakenvapi` to expose DLSS properly.  
* Changing upscaler inputs might cause the game to have a spasm, so recommended to restart the game afterwards. 

_Overall, game is held up by duct tape and good wishes._
