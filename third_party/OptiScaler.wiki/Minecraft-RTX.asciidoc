|**Known Issues**
a| 
* Requires using a 3rd party launcher (like https://github.com/MCMrARM/mc-w10-version-launcher/releases[MCLauncher] or https://bedrocklauncher.github.io[Bedrock Launcher]) and using Opti as `dxgi.dll` or `d3d12.dll`
* FSR 3.1 and XeSS 2.0.1 DP4a are flickerfests, FSR 2.1 looks the best maybe
* Optiscaler Overlay now invokes properly, but mouse input only works in pause menu, while keyboard input always (arrow keys, Tab and Space)
* Game seems to force DLSS Quality preset by default (only a toggle, no presets), but `UpscaleRatioOverrideEnabled=true` and setting the value `UpscaleRatioOverrideValue=` work (or use the Upscale Ratio Override in the overlay then press Save INI), albeit hit and miss - on 1080p, 1.5, 1.7., 2.0 and 3.0 worked, even random 2.5, but 1.0, 1.2 and 1.3 resulted in black bars and artifacts.
* Opti can't create the log file (missing permissions)
* **Old method** - use Opti as `nvngx.dll` and run `EnableSignatureOverride.reg`, use XeSS 1.1
