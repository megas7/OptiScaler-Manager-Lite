## Adding support for Nukem's dlssg‐to‐fsr3

**0.** For **AMD/Intel GPUs**, [Fakenvapi](Fakenvapi) is also **required** when using **Nukem mod** in order to successfully expose DLSS FG in-game and apply Nukems mod.  

**1.** Download the mod's regular (no extra name) version - [**dlssg-to-fsr3 NexusMods**](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/738) or [**dlssg-to-fsr3 Github**](https://github.com/Nukem9/dlssg-to-fsr3)   
  
**2.** Put ***ONLY*** the `dlssg_to_fsr3_amd_is_better.dll` in the same folder as Optiscaler (by the main game exe)   

> [!CAUTION]
> _DO NOT ADD any other file from Nukem ZIP, **especially** the 200kb `nvngx.dll`. You'll break the mod!_  
> **_ONLY_ transfer `dlssg_to_fsr3_amd_is_better.dll`!!!**

**3.** Set `FGType=nukems` in `Optiscaler.ini`    

**4.** Select **DLSS FG in-game** to activate
