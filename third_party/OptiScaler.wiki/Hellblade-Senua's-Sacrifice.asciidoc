|**Version**
|`OptiScaler_v0.7.7-pre7_20250224`

|**Filename**
|`dxgi.dll`

|**OS**
|`Manjaro` Linux / `Proton`

|**GPU**
|`AMD 6700XT`

|**Inputs**
|`DLSS` enabled in-game -> had to set up `fakenvapi` for this

|**Settings**
|`XeSS` and all `FSR` upscalers work fine

|**FG-Settings**
|`OptiFG`: `Enabled = true`, `HUDFix = true`, `AllowAsync = true`  

`Framerate`: `FramerateLimit = 80.0` (any value i tried works, and is smoother than using the built in framelimit configured in `GameUserSettings.ini`) 

|**Known Issues**
|-

|**Notes**
|`XeSS` looks more smooth, but has about double the frametime cost, and seems to swallow details compared to the `FSR` upscalers -> settled on `FSR 3`

`OptiFG` also has noticeable artifacting, but this game has so many weird effects applied to the image, that it does not look out of place`
