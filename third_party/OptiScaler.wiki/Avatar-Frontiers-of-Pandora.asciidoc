|**Version**
|OptiScaler_v0.7.7-pre9

|**Filename**
|`dxgi.dll`

|**OS**
|Win 11 24H2

|**GPU**
|RX 6950XT

|**Inputs**
|DLSS, XeSS, FSR3 (not working)

|**Settings**
|`Fsr3=false`, `Dxgi=false`

|**FG-Settings**
|-

|**Known Issues**
a|
* Game uses a custom FSR 3.0 interface which results in a crash when Optiscaler tries hooking the inputs. To fix crashes, set `Fsr3=false` in Optiscaler.ini and use XeSS inputs on AMD/Intel
* Spoofing has a big performance overhead (cca 20%) and seems to break rendering (atleast in dark places) - recommended `Dxgi=false` in Optiscaler.ini -

|**Notes**
a|
* On AMD, recommended to disable spoofing and use XeSS inputs due to previously mentioned issues
* Preset ratios are locked, can't override through Optiscaler; Ultra Quality is 1.2 ratio, Scaling mode Biased seems to dynamically alter the ratio, and Scaling mode Off forces Native AA (1.0 scaling) for the upscaler
