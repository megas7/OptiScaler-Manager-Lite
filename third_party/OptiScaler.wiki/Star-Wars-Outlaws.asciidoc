|**Known Issues**
a|
* Spoofing seems to break interior shadows - recommended to disable spoofing with `Dxgi=false` and use FSR or XeSS inputs
* Full game was updated to FSR 3.1, so the below fix should no longer be needed - demo is still FSR 3.0 tho  
* OLD - +++<s>Game uses a custom FSR 3.0 interface which results in a crash when Optiscaler tries hooking the inputs. To fix crashes, set `Fsr3=false` in Optiscaler.ini and use DLSS or XeSS inputs</s>+++
