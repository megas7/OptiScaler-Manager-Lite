|**Known Issues**
a|
* **Ultra Quality** presets seem to have the most issues - flickering and increased crashing
* Avoid using Ultra Quality with FSR4 - broken rendering
* Flickering with FSR4 can be "fixed" with `FSR4 non-linear sRGB option` enabled (cutscenes affected) - seems to cause more ghosting in dark areas on the other hand - recommended to just use another preset or set a custom preset ratio
* Game has custom post-processing shaders and does something weird with monitor resolutions - most likely the reason for flickering on certain presets 

|**Notes**
a|
* Having https://www.nexusmods.com/clairobscurexpedition33/mods/24[Lyall ClairObscurFix MOD] is essential for HudFix to disable forced post-process sharpening
* XeSS inputs are not useable with OptiFG (no depth)
