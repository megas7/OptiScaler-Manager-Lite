|**Version**

|**Filename**
|`dxgi.dll`

|**OS**
|Win 11 24H2

|**GPU**
|-

|**Inputs**
|DLSS

|**Settings**
|-

|**FG-Settings**
|-

|**Known Issues**
|HUDfix doesn't work properly, so OptiFG can't work without HUD ghosting or it just duplicates frames - no working FG since no DLSS FG either, using `Output Scaling` (with DLSS) might cause graphical corruption after cutscenes 

|**Notes**
|GPU's without Dirext 12 Ultimate support (only works for GTX 1600 series, GTX 1000 series are not supported at all) should set `D3DFeatureLevel=true` from `OptiScaler.ini`
